thank you thank you thank you to vice president pence hes a good guy weve done a great job together and merry christmas michigan thank you michigan what a victory we had in michigan what a victory was that one of the greats was that the greatest evening but im thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of christmas the greatness of america and the glory of god thank you very much and did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again did you notice saying merry christmas i remember when i first started this beautiful trip this beautiful journey i just said to the first lady you are so lucky i took you on this fantastic journey its so much fun they want to impeach you they want to do worse than that by the way by the way by the way it doesnt really feel like were being impeached the country is doing better than ever before we did nothing wrong we did nothing wrong and we have tremendous support in the republican party like weve never had before nobodys ever had this kind of support but this sacred season our country is thriving and its thriving truly like it has never it has never happened before to the extent whats happening now and by the way your state because of us not because of local government but because of us because of the job that weve done because i understand shes not fixing those potholes thats what the word is it was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you we dont want to do that but shes not fixing the potholes but michigans had the best year its ever had best year its ever had and thats because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and theyre coming in from japan and theyre coming in from a lot of other places look whats happening and you know i dont know if you know this but probably 10 years ago i was honored i was the man of the year by i think somebody whoever i was the man of the year in michigan can you believe it long time and that was long before i ever decided to do this i was happy i had a beautiful life what the hell did i do this for but look how were doing do we love it i love it but anyway i was the man of the year and probably close to 10 years ago and i came to michigan he said youre still the man of the year thank you who said that thank you so i came in and i remember the speech so well i said why are you allowing them to steal your car companies why are you allowing them to go to mexico and to go from china where they come in from china they build them in china they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs you lose your factories the companies leave and you get nothing why are they lying i asked that a long time ago and we stopped it weve stopped it and you see that and we just made the usmca were getting rid of nafta which i think is the worst trade deal ever and its very exciting its a great deal its a great deal its going to stop exactly what we were just talking about it makes it very very prohibitive they can do it but theyve got to pay a hell of a big price to do it and history has proven that stops them but we have a great usmca that we negotiated with mexico with canada now from the standpoint of the farmers you know whats going on we had tremendous trade barriers in canada we had attacks on dairy products 297 tariff nobody talked about it with canada and we had some really bad things with mexico we now have a wonderful deal and if we didnt have a good deal you know what i would have done what what i would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it right that would have been it unfortunately the deals been sitting with nancy pelosi for a long time and what happened and she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it so heres what happens so i get along with labor i had a lot of union labor vote for me tremendous amount of labor in new york where i come from we have a lot of unions and thats okay thats fine so we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed well give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal and now you have the democrats trying to take credit for this deal and thats okay whatever it takes for seven months it sits they dont do anything we give and by the way i spoke to the unions the day before i say fellows you got to get it done and union labor loves me and i love you too sir i love you too sir so we have a great deal with mexico with canada and it is true i say it out loud because i say it to them right now if they ever wanted to break the deal thats okay if somebody wants to break a deal with me you always have to have an alternative right and this country the deals we made we did a deal with south korea thats great we did a deal with japan 40 billion dollar deal with japan it was just a little piece of a deal okay that was a piece of a deal and i said to japan look you got to make this deal or were going to put a 20 tariff on the cars and thats more money than anything were talking about thats all right thats all right thats all right get her out ger her out of here oh well youre about to hear the greatest speech youve ever heard and thats going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot massive riots fake news but seriously look look look they wont say it they wont say it because when we have protesters all in favor they dont talk about it but theres a slob theres a real slob wait wait a minute shell get hell when she gets back home with mom but she made look she screams a little bit and you know what i like to do avoid them because ill tell you the big problem i could hardly hear her what happens is all of you people go crazy look look look and the place okay so theres one disgusting person who made wait wait who made a i wouldnt say this but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right now they wont say that the fake news they wont say it if one of us did that it would be like the biggest story ever i think its terrible and ill tell you the other thing i dont know who the security company is but the police came up but they want to be so politically correct so they dont grab her wrist lightly and get her out they say oh would you please come would you please come with me sure maam would you and then she gives the guy the finger and he oh oh you got to get a little bit stronger than that folks and they making another group of tariffs seven and a half percent this gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal which they want to start but were taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year helps the farmers so you know what we do out of that big check that we get all that money flows into the treasury out of the big check we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year and you know the incredible thing and i was with a lot of farmers i was with a group of 36 farmers at the white house you know what they said to me i said dont worry about it were going to take care of you guys and i used a bad word you know what word i used were going to get you a subsidy and they said this two years ago i said how much were you targeted for this was the first year 12 billion sir the second year was 16 they were target thats what they didnt get from china so i said its all right were going to give you a subsidy of the same and were going to take it out of the tariffs and were going to have billions and billions of dollars left over and they said sir we dont want money we just want a level playing field ive never seen that before ive never seen that before so we will have invested in our military since im here which is less than three years our military by the way in all due respect to the previous two administrations our military was depleted it was depleted it was in bad shape we had fighter jets that were 35 years old we had planes that were 60 years you heard where the father flew them the grandfather flew them and now the young son comes in weve got the best equipment in the world now spent two and a half trillion dollars made in the usa two and a half trillion we will shortly thatll be all finished were going to have the greatest now we have the best planes were going to have the best ships were building a lot of ships now were building the most powerful weapons in the world now we dont want to even talk about it we never want to use them but you know the way were not going to have to use them is if we have them were building submarines the power of which nobodys ever seen before nobodys ever seen before its funny we have these companies come in i like to make good deals you like to make good deals thats what we do right so these really countries that come in prime ministers presidents sometimes dictators those we cant deal with too much sir wed like to buy a nuclear submarine i say no thanks i turn them all down you have no idea how many people but were building some of the theyre the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind i say mankind and womankind they can definitely fight theyre the real deal these guys so good looking i said you could be a movie star go to hollywood no sir i like doing what im doing so i said to these guys you going to see just like central casting i said i said fellas how good is this plane they said sir its great why because the enemy cant see it that helps stealth its actually called super stealth so i said you mean they cant see so you shoot at them but they cant he said they have no idea where we are sir i said that sounds good to me nobody does it nobody can do it we have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes we bought in a lot of great stuff and i wont tell you the story but very early on i thought we were going to have a problem someplace and one of the generals came up to me and said sir dont go dont do it why we dont have the ammunition and i said two things i never want to hear a president right we never want to have a president hear that again nor do we want a president to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then but another thing we did which to me is such an incredible thing to have done its such an honor so our last us armed forces the last branch was the air force right that was many many decades ago we are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the united states armed forces the space force so ill be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else see that space force that was my baby and you think that was easy thats not easy because you have democrats that do not like our military they do not like our military and we did something yesterday because for three years i would see people that run incredible people the heads of the historically black colleges and universities in the country and every year theyd come in and theyd be looking for help they needed help and they do need help with it and its great and they do an incredible job so many great schools but they need help and every year theyd have to come and come i got to know them actually i said the only bad thing is you wont see me too much anymore because we just provided record funding for a nations historically black colleges and universities and its longterm theyre not going to have to come so i said look we could do it where we do it every year or well do what we have what do you want they said let us just have it so well miss them but they are great people theyve done an incredible job and our extraordinary jobs boom which created another 266000 jobs last month and then you add the undercount from the previous two months youre close to 300000 jobs and they said if youre a business watcher which i am i love watching business but they said they were guessing could be 70000 could be 80000 maybe 90 maybe 110 somebody said then the number comes out 266000 with an adjustment remember about four months ago when we had one little period right we had one little period where there was a little downturn they said oh oh we think were going into a recession i said dont worry about it we think were going into a recession they were willing to lose their wealth they were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own what do you guys own back there let it go theyll go bust they dont care anything to get rid of us not me us and you know what then all of a sudden and now for the last couple of weeks weve set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets so as of yesterday weve had 133 record days in the stock market now and thats in less than three years so when i see that i dont care because i dont im not allowed to have stock i cant have stock they consider it a conflict of interest and that i can understand i agree i can but you know what ill tell you what what i see i see tremendous job growth because were setting records but you know what i also see the 401ks where people are up 90 theyre up 97 theyre up 82 i tell you the story all the time i mean i have people coming up to me and a man came up a policeman ive told this story but ive had many so many times but this guy in particular because it was early and that was a year ago that was a long time ago right now its much higher than that but he said sir i want to thank you my wife thinks im a loser all my life we never did well with the 401ks with stocks everything i invested im up 72 sir she thinks im a financial genius shes so in love with me she so in love he said she said darling i think youre one of the greatest investors why dont you do this professionally and i dont even know what im doing sir i just have all these stocks so i just wanted to tell you i look at a 401k who has 401ks here so thats what i see i dont care about the rich ones i care about everybody i care i care about everybody actually ford motor company just announced that it is investing 15 billion dollars into auto factories in the detroit area creating another 3000 michigan jobs and thats on top of the many other investments weve gotten from japanese companies car companies and other companies but theyre all coming in and a lot of them are coming to michigan and i say hey go to michigan sometimes theyll go south and thats okay whatever i want them in this country but ideally i want to fill them up were doing so well in michigan with the auto companies now youre back youre back so youre back very proud of you very proud of you but while were creating jobs fighting for michigan workers and achieving numbers that youve never seen before incredible victories for the american people are happening the radical left in congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage you see whats going on ill tell you these people are crazy you ever hear its the economy stupid you know that was clintons saying if you have a good economy i have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it nobody talks about it if youre a democrat they say oh its the economy if the economys any good and let me just tell you a little secret if crooked hillary wouldve won your economy would have crashed you were going down the regulations were taking it down the taxes were taking it down instead of being up 92 or whatever youre up a lot you would have been down you would have been at less than half it was crashing for all those people that would say oh its the obama let me tell you something you were dying and if you look at that first period of a couple of months it was a disaster but it was heading south and as sure as youre standing and im sorry we couldnt get you seats we didnt have any room and by the way 20000 people outside had to leave you know its so cold outside we told them dont worry about a screen go home go home and watch but we had this is about a 5500 seat arena and i said to my people why so small are we spoiled i watch these guys come in like biden he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up no its true i dont understand it and did you see the new polls from usa today came out im killing everybody and they hate me usa today hates me but theres a poll were beating everybody but so biden has this rally theyve got 200 seats but only a small number of people so you know what they do they set up a round table so think of these people they come in they think theyre going to listen to the speech they end up sitting on a round table discussing they mustve been happy right we dont have enough room for round tables im sorry folks no they set up a round table but i think were doing great and how do you beat what weve done with the economy with our great vets with choice youve finally got choice theyve been trying to get it for almost 50 years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years four more years and these people back here your seat or stand is better right but you know what theyre going to be much more famous because the cameras cant see you they can only see them and the other thing the cameras do you ever notice i go to these stadiums 25 30000 people they never show the crowd you know why because they dont want to have if crazy pocahontas if crazy pocahontas goes to the middle of central park or whatever shes in manhattan you got me and people i mean i could have i could have baron trump go into central park and hed get a crowd that would be just as hes 13 hed get a bigger crowd but if she has the crowd oh these crowds are so big ive had crowds over the last couple of weeks we went to different pennsylvania florida but i mean thousands and thousands of people cant get into these nba arenas right big arenas and we set records at everyone because we use the floor thank you i appreciate it but we use the floor right the basketball court so we set records at every arena they never even mention the crowds they never mention the crowds its sort of amazing you know what i dont think weve ever had an empty seat from the time i came down the escalator thats a long time ago i dont think weve ever had an empty seat now what the crooked media does though if you got like over here look how packed it is and theres thousands outside but i please go home youre going to catch pneumonia but heres the thing if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom those cameras will turn to those two seats and theyll say trump wasnt able to fill up the arena i always get nervous when i see some i know theyre coming back nobody ever leaves our speeches because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally but every time i see a man get up i see a beautiful woman with a baby and theyre getting up the babys going crazy and theyre getting up theyre going to take it but i know theyre going to be right back and i say fill those two seats i dont want them to see it because theyll say couldnt fill up the arena these are truly dishonest people after three years of sinister witch hunts hoaxes scams tonight the house democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic americans capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history was that the greatest remember when they all said remember when they all said no no you cant win michigan you cant then i went i did one in grand rapids right grand rapids we had 32000 people that night it was one oclock in the morning that means it was election day when i started speaking hillary barack obama michelle obama and bill clinton they did an emergency trip they did an emergency trip to michigan at six oclock they got here at prime time they started to speak she had 500 people i got here at one oclock in the morning the next day which is now election day how many people were there 32000 people outside inside it was the last speech of michigan and they say well sir its very hard to win michigan i said why would it be hard heres the beautiful thing everything i told you ive done but much more so i said i was going to bring car companies back i said i was going to bring in i just hope you people know that i just hope you know it but ill never forget that night and in all fairness to bill clinton he used to be a friend of mine until i ran for office i like him i like him but he told you know the way they tried to shut him out right because hes a pro hes an instinct guy right hes instinct he doesnt need right because hes a pro hes an instinct guy right hes instinct he doesnt need polling companies who the hell wants him you know if you want a polling company pick up the newspaper the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write they write fake polls its true they write fake polls you call them suppression polls you read them and you get depressed because it looks like youre doing badly they do that i think its almost worse than what they write and you cant get much worse than what they write so what happens is bill clinton said to crooked hillary his very dishonest wife crooked hillary do you think he calls her crooked hillary he might maybe he just calls her crooked he said crooked im telling you crooked i dont like what im seeing in michigan i dont like what im seeing in wisconsin he said i took the trip to wisconsin and ill tell you what they had those trumppence signs all the way to the convention area every lawn every loan i dont like wisconsin and then he said oh dont worry about it what the hell does he know they told him what do you know remember they shut him out at the they didnt want him talking he was right i mean i dont want to cause any problems in the family but he was right but he talked about wisconsin then he talked about michigan he said crooked im telling you crooked i dont like what im seeing in michigan i was in michigan and im telling you they had those damn signs i saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn and two of them on the car and he said you horrible human being youd better start listening to me because youre going to get your ass whooped and you know what happened you know what happened she didnt listen fortunately and she didnt come to michigan enough and she didnt come to wisconsin i think at all right because her polling data looked good it looked good to me too every time i went there with these crowds so we won wisconsin we won michigan and the great ronna mcdaniel where is ronna where is ronna ronna she was so horrible i didnt know her ronna mcdaniel and she was so aggressive she kept calling and said could you please come out to michigan i said who the hell are you and i said what do you mean another trip so anyway i made we had these big crowds i made it again then finally i said two weeks out i said ronna no more were going to win it or were not okay 00 in the evening for this final deal in grand rapids sir could you come to michigan tonight and i thought i was just about finished i went to a last great state and i said its over now i sit back and i watch and lets see what happens right but she said could you come to michigan i said that is the most aggressive human being ive ever met and we did it and we won michigan and the word is that were much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in michigan you better remember when you walk into you know its november 3rd this time november 3rd by the way though that evening that incredible evening in november one of the biggest nights in the history of television you never hear them say it so i might as well that election and my debates you see their debates are dying who wants to watch buttigieg buttigieg buttigieg you know that you pronounce it they say i heard some guy saying no no because its an unpronounceable name thats why they call him mayor pete right mayor pete mayor pete mayor pete ive had you up to here mayor pete no buttigieg is leading how does no you say it this way you say it they call him mayor pete because nobody can pronounce his last name thats the only people think it says by the way you know what im not going to say bad things about him you know why id love him to win i thought i knocked off pocahontas i did it a year too early a year too early i give her credit she then started to come back i dont think shes going to make it though shes gasping shes gasping for air but i saw them pronouncing buttigieg and they said heres what you do boot edge edge say edge like the edge of a building edge edge buttigieg alfred e newman you got to be older to know what that means but congressional democrats are directly attacking 23 million michigan voters who rose up in 2016 won the state and now the democrats are very upset they want to get michigan back they just dont know how to do it because they didnt do a thing for michigan they didnt do anything for michigan all they did was take away your companies and let them go to mexico and other places you know i dont know if you know it mexico has 32 of your car business you know that right not because of me theyre not moving but mexico has 32 of our car business moved to mexico can you believe this before i got there but thats what i used to talk about i said when i was honored that night i said how do you let this happen how do you let all these companies leave it used to go its probably maybe the single biggest reason i ran for president it might be the and i had a lot of them immigration i had a lot of them but that may be the single biggest with todays illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment the do nothing democrats and they are do nothing all they want to do is focus on this what they could be doing are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the american voter this lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the democrat party have you seen my polls in the last four weeks its crazy its crazy you know why because people we have an election right down the road i announced three months ago that im running right ill give you a little clue i announced because i figured once i announce theyd never impeach nobody would be so stupid but theyd been trying to impeach me from day one theyve been trying to impeach me from before i ran okay because if you remember when i ran i went immediately to number one never came off number one we had center stage from day one in the debates so we had i dont know 14 15 debates we had a total of 18 actually people forgot there was one that they never talk about it but thats okay but we had 18 people and i was center stage and i said wait a minute this is no good i want odd numbers because of your center stage if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle so i said make it 11 or make it nine or im not showing up and generally they did it because we were way ahead from the beginning but i made a lot of great friends out of that group and many of them are good friends today although you wouldnt know it based on the they say that was the meanest that was a pretty mean primary you got to say wasnt that fun i liked it through their depraved actions today crazy nancy pelosis house democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame and it really is its a disgrace democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president they think that the washington swamp which we believe it or not it aint easy because they got so much stacked including these guys you know what these guys are apart of the democrat party they are a part of it you might as well call them democrats you know its owned by commicast theyre just as bad as cnn or theyre just as bad as msnbc and by the way cnn and msnbc their ratings are down the tubes its great i love it i love it but they think the washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election thats what they think theres never been a time like this think of it you have the greatest economy in the history of the world other countries come to see me all of their leaders and they say sir first thing sir congratulations on your economy were trying to do the same thing congratulations sir and these guys dont like talking about it and if they do they say obama did it oh obama obama remember obama said you will never be president he will never be president then remember he said i will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president and then i became president he wasnt so happy and in all fairness he campaigned harder than crooked hillary because he had more strength i mean i go to these places secret service they take me i havent seen a lobby in three years its true i go through basements i pass compactor plants i know more about compactors from this job i dont see lobbies i say fellows you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby no sir but ill tell you what i go upstairs downstairs all around theyre taking me up three flights go down one i said are we almost there yes sir another four flights and i say you think hillary could do this i dont think so theyd bring her back home she wants to go to sleep and now i hear she wants to run again wouldnt that be great oh thank you thank you oh would we love that you think the democrats are screwed up wait until that happens wouldnt that be oh theres my guy lock her up lock her up lock her up well look based on the fbi report you just saw what happened with the ig where they came out with the fbi based on that you know what i never stopped you but now think of what they did think of what they did think of how dishonest it all was they shouldnt even be allowed to have an impeachment because it was based on dishonesty it was based on illegality she went out and they paid for a fake dossier they gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier totally disproven totally fake the fbi then took that fake dossier and they used it in the fisa court to get approval to spy on my campaign and if we were democrats they wouldve been in jail two years ago its a disgrace think of what they did so they use this fake dossier and they brought it before this big deal court its a big deal the fisa court and they said this stuff and they lied about it because comey whos another beauty did i do a great job when i fired his ass what a great job oh no they had bad plans no i did a great thing that was like throwing a rock at a hornets nest did that place explode and then we learned about lisa page and her wonderful lover peter strzok i love you lisa i love you more than anybody in the world i love you more than anybody in the world it causes problems with the wife but we wont talk about that those tapes didnt work well no how about those statements right and then they say in all fairness i really liked the report but how does the inspector general say because dont forget he was appointed by obama so im not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets but we had a lot of those nuggets how does the inspector general say you have these horrible hes going to lose isnt he hes going to lose or shes going to win 100 million did you see all the zeros it was like im blinking i says i think its 100 hes going to lose 100 to one isnt he peter i love you so much peter ive never loved anyone like you hes going to lose 100 million to one peter right thats right hes going to lose 100 million to one but theres no bias how about the insurance policy to me the greatest just in case she loses we have an insurance policy were in the insurance policy right now folks weve been in it for three years thats what they meant i mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator because were doing awfully well and ill tell you something rush limbaugh said it sean hannity said it laura ingram said it tucker said it ainsley said it but a lot of people have said it they said theres nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened and still created one of the greatest economies and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years i understand that i understand that but its my life very unfair to my family i have to say this very very unfair to my family what they put my family through is a disgrace me its my life its fine i do but you know what what they put my family through is a disgrace and they ought to be ashamed and we should get apologies all over the place so yesterday i sent pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning her partys outrageous abusive power thats what it is they have nothing theyre the ones that should be impeached every one of them i mean you got this guy schiff he makes up a statement and he goes in front of congress where he has immunity and he makes up a statement from me thats totally fictitious totally out of thin air the worst statement ive ever heard many people saw it i had a person two weeks ago that said i didnt love the statement you made i said really didnt you read the transcripts i always say read the transcript but didnt you read it no no i heard it on television i watched adam schiff he made it up i then sent him the transcript he said oh now i feel better thats perfect i call it perfect he called it perfect everyone calls it if you read it but heres the thing he makes up this statement and it finished didnt he have eight quid pro quos eight could you imagine youre dealing with a country and you say eight times that youve got to do something the first time they say well the second time they say thats strange third time they say whats wrong you said eight times eight times theyd have you arrested theyd have you put into an insane asylum but he actually said i think he said eight not seven eight and then he finished with dont call me ill call you can you imagine the president of the united states dont call me ill call you you know what that is thats a mafia statement okay thats the head of the mafia saying dont call me this guy actually said that and then he walked away and people became incensed because they knew that wasnt the people that read the thing most people believed him hes a liar because you know hes a corrupt politician 100 no hes a corrupt and then i see him by the way you ever see this guy he walks up to the mics i mean were not all fairness look i dont want to be because with me too i never even think about looks anymore okay i dont talk about looks of a male or a female but in his case lets just say the last time ill ever refer to this hes not exactly the best looking guy weve ever seen no any mic he walks up to the mic and hes so just this is a sad sad day for america our president is an employee of russia i have absolute proof that the president this is at the beginning and every week theyd say wheres the proof its coming its coming then we get the mueller report nothing and ill tell you what i know some of the people in this audience if i spent not 45 million not 18 trump haters i call them the angry democrats it was 13 then it went to 18 and then mueller did muller do a good job did he do a good job no boo how was his performance in front of congress boo not the best but think of this 45 million they spent and you know i heard somebody say well we got back some of that money let me tell you you cost this country billions and billions and billions of dollars in all of the things that didnt get done in all of the embarrassment to our country you caused billions and billions of dollars and it was a hoax but this guy schiff i have absolute proof i have this i have that this that anytime he sees a camera and hes stone faced stone faced hes a pathological liar he gets up and ive never seen anything like it even i was saying i wonder what he has what does he have he says i have absolute i said i havent spoken to russia in year what the hell do i have to do with russia but this guy gets up oh i think we have a vote coming in haleigh wow thank you haleigh great job wow the republican party has never been so affronted but theyve never been so united as they are right now ever never and i know the senators and theyre great guys and women too we have some great women we have great guys theyre great people they love this country theyre going to do the right thing theyre going to do the right thing so i said in my letter to pelosi i love that you know usually theres one two the republicans look ive said it for a long time the democrats are lousy politicians they really are theyve got horrible policies open borders crime is fine drugs pouring through i mean think of what they do sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities theyre lousy politicians but they have one thing two things they are vicious theyre the most vicious people the republicans arent as vicious they may learn to be vicious after going through this though but the other thing the democrats always stick together now think of it three democrats went over to our side no republicans its unheard of and by the way this is for a hundred years im not just talking about this little point in time the republicans are known as its always harder to stick together these people are great we have a great republican party and we have to get that change we have to take back the house youll have the greatest healthcare ever if we take and by the way we had another victory the individual mandate just a little while ago it came over the wires it was just upheld the individual mandate is now gone the most unpopular part of obamacare it was just upheld so i said in my letter to pelosi by proceeding with your invalid impeachment youre violating your oath of office youre breaking your allegiance to the constitution youre declaring open war on american democracy you dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for americas founding and your egregious conduct and listen though its so true it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged and in fact their very lives to build you are the ones interfering in americas elections you are the one subverting americas democracy we did nothing wrong nothing whatsoever this was just an excuse you are the ones that are obstructing justice you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish personal political and partisan gain theyre bringing pain the work we could be doing on lowering drug prices on getting rid of these horrible horrible situations you know in the border the woman is okay is she okay okay thank you very much thank you i mean some of these people are waiting here for three days right thank you theyll come back come back merry christmas thank you merry christmas is true but what theyve done with this perversion its perversion and when you watch some of these people get up and speak today they dont even you have violated the constitution well what does he done wrong well we dont know that they dont even have any crime this is the first impeachment where theres no crime i say tell me what i did please well we dont know you violated the constitution you had turley whos smart alan dershowitz these guys all of them they said theres no crime theres no crime right theres no crime theres no crime im the first person that ever get impeached and theres no crime i feel guilty you know what they call it impeachment light its impeachment light thats why with richard nixon i just see it as a very dark era very dark very oh you dont even like to think i dont know about you but im having a good time its crazy but i also know we have a great group of people behind us in the republican party we really do maybe i wouldnt feel the same way but we have a great group of people behind us we had in the house and we have it in the senate theyre doing a great job so im not worried im not worried because its always good when you dont do anything wrong you get impeached that may be a record that will last forever but you know what they have done theyve cheapened the impeachment process and now anybody that become this is a sacred position anybody that becomes president i mean they could have a phone call and they get impeached so if the republicans if you had a democrat as president we have a republican house they dont like the guy for whatever reason or the woman they impeach the person its cheapened it its exactly what our founding fathers didnt want and they said it could happen and its happened but i know one thing americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote pelosi the hell out of office but its so disappointing i see a woman carolyn maloney shes a long time nothing much believe me shes a congresswoman from manhattan the east side i was with her her first race i helped her she was always so nice oh thank you thank you i made lots of contributions over the years in new york if youre not a its purely democrat especially in manhattan so what happens i make lots of contributions for years and years and years i go run the first person i see carolyn maloney i raise my hand to impeach well give me back the damn money that ive been paying her for so many years let her pay me back all the money let her pay me back all the money then you have this dingell dingell you know dingell from michigan you know dingell you ever hear of her michigan debbie dingell thats a real beauty so she calls me up like eight months ago her husband was here a long time but i didnt give him the b treatment i didnt give him the c or the d i couldve nobody what is you know i gave the a treatment take down the flags while youre taking them down for excongressman dingell oh okay do this do that do that rotunda everything i gave him everything thats okay i dont want anything for it i dont need anything for anything she calls me up its the nicest thing thats ever happened thank you so much john would be so thrilled hes looking down hed be so thrilled thank you so much sir i said thats okay dont worry about it maybe hes looking up i dont know i dont know maybe maybe but lets assume hes looking down but i gave him a not a not b not b i gave him the a and she called me she said oh no i wont go into the conversation because its not fair do that but all i want to say is lets put it this way it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get on a scale of zero to 10 it was a 10 okay so that was what february or something now they talk about this phony impeachment and shes out there well we have to look seriously at our president because he may have violated the constitution of the united states boo and i cant be happy with that because i love our country i love this and i love that she loves everything i said shes a no okay no but i look at her and shes so sincere and what happens i vote to impeach trump and you know what i didnt say who the hell knew this was even going to come up i went through the whole muller hoax they did this big report i was totally exonerated they didnt even bring it up at the impeachment because i was totally exonerated if they saw one little kernel one little quarter of a sentence look what they did with one word remember this what did i do why did i do its us but they dont say it that way they say i they read it totally different schiff and his band of thieves they read it now i say basically very simple do us a favor our country do us do us not me our country and then what do i say i say the united states attorney general attorney general of the united states could speak to you it would be great okay because its known for major corruption in fact the new leader of ukraine got in on a construction on a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty and everything that was going on in ukraine right he looked for it thats how he got into office he got into office that way so we take it and they repeat it a thousand times and they never say with the right so i go wild and we start and the republicans have got it right now we always correct him but i use the word us us is the united states our country and then it actually says i think comma country but they dont say that they say do me a favor how many times have you heard it where they say in a speech and then the president said do me a favor well thats not what i said i said do us a favor our country and then i said the attorney general of the united states i didnt say my campaign i said the attorney general of the united states i didnt say my campaign manager okay i said the attorney and these people want to impeach the president of the united states for that oh and then what happened right then what happened so then the president of ukraine whos a quality person said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever that was a killer for the democrats right then his foreign minister said the same thing he said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever there was no pressure thats a killer so now did you see what the democrats did a couple of days ago they tried to say that hes not a strong person that he was weak they used the word weak that he was weak and under the power of trump he said do you know how insulting that is anybody that becomes president of a country and thats a big country and its a tough country you got to be tough hes tough but so what theyre saying now is he was weak because the wording it just doesnt fit okay these are really dishonest people and if the press was fair this thing never would have happened so the house democrats are surrendering their majority their dignity their reputations they look like a bunch of fools and ill tell you we have a lot of new stars in the republican party i could read off a list of 20 names but theyre giving up their honor and theyll receive a big backlash at the box office when you take a look that ballot box that ballot box on november 3rd i think were going to have crowds like weve never had and ill tell you something it used to be theyd always say oh the republicans you know in 2018 i didnt run i didnt run right they all said oh we didnt well actually we picked up two seats in the senate that these guys never talk about we just approved 171 federal court justices 171 federal justices including courts of appeal 171 well be up probably by the end of the year to 182 and for that i thank president obama he gave me 142 openings he gave me 142 i said to him my people i got there because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and supreme court we have two great supreme court judges right two justices of the supreme court kavanaugh gorsuch two great men theyre great and how about the pain that they put justice kavanaugh through right over a phony deal i hate to tell you over a phony deal what a disgrace what they put that man through and that family through just remember it come november you got to remember its a long time you know in the life of trump 10 months is an eternity its a long time somebody said congratulations sir youre going to win i said dont say that just dont talk about it lets always pretend youre one point down like last time going to be close nope its going to be close but what they put that man through was horrible what they put his family through was horrible and you know those stories largely have been recanted and frankly the ones that didnt recant i dont know what a supreme court judge does but he should sue them he should sue them so we want to take back the house well hold the senate and well keep the white house you will have the greatest healthcare you will continue with the greatest judges you know we have judges that are we just had a great story in the wall street journal i have to be always very truthful because if im a little bit off they call me a liar theyll say he gets a pinocchio the stupid washington post they have pinocchio i mean even if youre saying things perfectly its a pinocchio theres nothing you can say where you dont get a pinocchio but what happens what happens is we have wall street journal the other day got the best story they said whether you like him or not the job hes done on judges and supreme court justices but the job hes done on judges is amazing say its the most important thing see i dont agree i say defense is the most the military is the most but once youre beyond the military i mean to me defense is the most important because without good defense maybe we dont need judges so much right its like somebody said well we violated the budget i said do me a favor dont worry about the budget if were attacked and arent doing very well and somebody says well at least we have a good budget that doesnt work too well right that doesnt work so we have great military we have great judges we have great everything drug prices down for the first time in 51 years drug prices came down and that was with no help from the democrats if they helped because you need their votes if they helped i could get those drug prices down 40 and 50 okay and we just approved and were approving very soon for the governor of florida ron desantis where he can buy he has the right to go were giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country where the prices for the identical drug identical drug are 50 less hes going to do that for the people of florida and were going to do that for your governors if they want to do that well get that down so far everyone in america can see straight through the washington democrats phony dangerous charade schiff makes up so many things pelosi makes it up and she backs him up i saw her on a television show and george stephanopoulos thats another beauty he said even he said he was defending me i couldnt believe it he made this statement but you know he lied on that he made up this stuff no he didnt he didnt so that means nancy pelosi said no the statement that he made up but its all going to end soon and its going to come out to a beautiful great victory for the republican party and for this nation thank you very much so thats it we have the greatest country weve turned around a ship we need four more years if we dont have it now if you want to drive them crazy we had one group in pennsylvania some guy started screaming 16 more years 16 they went crazy and you know what they dont understand when i do get out theyre all going to go out of business theyre making more money than theyve ever made that crazy new york times one of the worst newspapers in the world one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world totally phony they came out with a story where it was a great headline for me and the people that read it the super radical left they called and complained so much that they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative on a good story can you believe it no theyre among the most dishonest people but ill never forget before i took that great escalator ride down with our first lady our first lady is doing a great job great job i said first lady youre so lucky i took you on this journey this wonderful beautiful journey and it is you know why its a wonderful beautiful journey because look at what were accomplishing is unbelievable its unprecedented it is unprecedented what were accomplishing youre so lucky i said it to all my people i have great people in the back i say you folks are so lucky i took you on this you could be home right now relaxing but id rather be here frankly than any place these rallies are great theyre inspiring you are inspiring and you know its funny were not even into election season yeah its a long way away were not even in it and yet i think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election does that make any sense i think a lot of it has to do with a witch hunt a lot of it has to do with the phony witch hunt because youre smart people youre the elite theyre not the elite youre the elite youre the elite you do better than they do they talk about it dont you hate it well the elite oh really i went to better schools many of you went to better schools we wont talk about homes even though your homes are nicer we wont talk about jobs you see the jobs reports you see whats happening do you see where wages are going up you know when i first started when i was here one of my first speeches i was talking that people made more money that was four years ago so it was 20 years before that so thats 24 25 years ago they made more money 24 years ago than they were making when i got elected president and they worked one job versus two or three jobs now its going up beautifully and we want that the salaries and you know the number one group of people that are going up is the blue collar worker its percentage the best the blue collar worker they had two and three jobs the blue collar worker is going up the most anyway so you know what else the thing im happiest about african american unemployment the lowest in the history of our country african american remember i used to say you remember look at you are you the greatest guy everyone thinks do i pay im telling you i have a group of african american guys and gals by the way that follow me around and they think i pay them and i dont i love them they love me they come how many rallies have you come to a lot theyre great people just great thank you i dont even know who the hell he is is that right i dont know him but i like him i see him at so many rallies i appreciate it you and your group theyre great people thank you so youre obviously doing well if you can travel around like that right ah he knows i appreciate it i really do i think its fantastic thank you thank you but think of this africanamerican unemployment is the lowest its ever been in the history of our country their poverty levels they had a horrible poverty level in the negative sense now their poverty levels are the best theyve ever been in the history of our country same with hispanic americans the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers and the same with asians the best unemployment and women im sorry 71 years best in 71 years ive let the women down but i think within another couple of months youll be historical so only 71 years best the best in 71 years but what were doing has been an incredible thing its an incredible thing when im on the debate stage with one of these characters and they try and say negative stuff ill just say well heres the story in the history of our country this group is doing the best and that group is doing the best and the women are doing the best and everybodys doing and frankly you know what it is the whole countrys doing the best okay the whole country is doing the best so we have records and everything and yet theyre trying to and they really are ive never seen anything like it theyre accusing me really of doing what joe biden biden admitted what he did how about this they protect him did you see the crummy debate those debates are so boring theyre dying in the ratings theyre dying theyre dying while its totally unsupported whats unsupported hes on tape saying that hes holding back 1 billion from ukraine unless you change the prosecutor how about that question i wont say who answered because you know im not i actually used to like the guy he was a nice guy to me but now i dont like him so much but thats okay but he goes while its totally unsubstantiated and while we beg your mercy that were asking you even to bring up this question but president trump said you refused to give 1 billion of taxpayer money to ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your sons company and sleepy joe gives a sleepy answer and thats the end of it thats it then whenever i bring it up do you ever notice they always use while these charges are totally unsubstantiated hes on tape if that were me its the electric chair they would bring the electric chair back no the guys on tape and they always say its unsubstantiated it is not supported by fact one of them the other day they finally changed the word it is supported by fact no its supported by tape no its unbelievable in many ways id like to have him win because number one hes going to have to eventually answer that question and number she said he doesnt know where he is thats the other problem now ive been doing this for a long time and i have much bigger crowds than anybodys ever had in history by the way do you know what i say it against the fake news because you know what theyre going to say every stadium is packed i give my people one instruction get the largest stadium you can get now thats why i was a little surprised but in battle creek you dont have that many right not too many stadiums but i wanted to be here you know why i wanted to be here first of all the crowd is incredible the crowd outside but let me tell you no you know why i wanted to be here because we have a lot of choices but i wanted to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly and i said i want to be there pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple i wanted to be here for that reason and i just want to say thank you because ill tell you what you came in i dont know i didnt get 100 but we got a damn good percentage right we got a damn good percentage so its really thrilling to be here but were joined tonight by many terrific

you terry come on up and while democrats are obsessed with impeachment were focused on jobs jobs jobs this group local leaders and all your washington folks they are right where they have to be in washington tonight thank you thank you great job thank you very much weve eliminated more jobkilling regulations than any administration in the history of our country whether its four years or eight years or in one case much more than eight years in a period of two and a half years we have eliminated more regulations than any other president by far youre saving almost 3000 a year because of regulation cuts total income gains for median households will reach 10000 a family ill give you a couple of quick numbers so under president bush for eight years you saved 450 meaning you took in 450 bucks okay fine under president obama you took in 975 under president trump including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cut savings its more than 10000 in less than three years pretty good right so for two eightyears you had a 400 450 and a 975 thats eight years 450 in less than three years you had more than 10000 that goes right into your pockets its one of the reasons our economy is doing well because as they say the consumer is doing better than theyve ever done and thats great thats what we wanted weve ended the war on american energy and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on planet earth and these maniacs want to close it up how about going to texas you know beto what remember what he said i said oh this guys a loser you know a salesman like if youre a great salesman you never talk that youre a great salesman you dont walk in and say well im a great salesman i can sell any guy that does that theyre no good its those quiet type that get you you know the ones that dont talk so beto when he first got in remember this clown he gets in no no he gets in i was made for this job to run for president after about two weeks they killed him he was gone but you remember he was against the bible he was against religion he was against guns and he was against oil and gas and he comes from texas i said thats a platform think of it hes against religion hes against guns and against oil and gas think of it i dont like to bring it up because hes gone zone but he comes from texas i said abraham lincoln cant win in texas with that platform but they are all of them they want to close up your energy its a big deal they want to close up your steel mills they dont want your steel mills look at what ive done for steel i mean the steel is back we taxed all of the dump steel coming in from china and other places and your steel mills that are doing great theyre expanding all over the country and they were going to be out of business within two years the way they were going they were gone united states steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions every major democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas powered automobiles and destroy the us auto industry forever and you know why because they have these maniacs that say you got to go all electric i want to have an alternative a big alternative youre going to always have the alternative and a lot of people dont know of the electric can ever catch the gas you know and by the way therell be different forms of energy coming along but they want to close them up and were not closing them up were going to have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing you can have it for a lot of different reasons were even bringing back the old light bulb you heard about that right the old light bulb which is better i say why do i always look so orange you know why because of the new light theyre terrible you look terrible they cost you many many times more like four or five times more and you know theyre considered hazardous waste when a light bulb is out youve got to bring it to a dump so lets say over here in battle creek wheres your nearest dump okay thats what a couple of hundred miles away so every time you lose drive a couple of hundred miles right i said how many people do that nobody what do they do they throw it in the garbage but you know what it is because its all gas its much more expensive four or five times more and i came into office i did a lot of this sinks showers all of this stuff i did a lot of it no water comes out you have areas where theres so much water you dont know what to do with it you turn on the shower youre not allowed to have any water anymore i mean we do a lot of it dishwashers we did the dishwasher right you press it remember the dishwasher youd press it boom thered be like an explosion five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out the dishes now you press it 12 times the women tell me again you know they give you four drops of water and theyre in places where theres so much water they dont know what to do with it so we just came out with a reg on dishwashers were going back to the old by the way by the time they press it 10 times you spend more on water and electric dont forget the whole thing is worse because youre spending all that money on electric so were bringing back standards that are great and better machinery that you can have the water again right but with the light bulb i said whats going on with the light bulbs a lot of people are complaining about the cost so i had a couple of experts come in i said tell me what gives a better light well we liked the old light bulb better i said i like it better and so what i did is you can have either one if you want to buy the newer kind you can and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like i do so were bringing back the old light bulb so its a much less expensive it probably gives a better light but whatever it is and youll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb i mean it sounds like little but its big stuff okay its big stuff and were doing it with a lot of other things our dishwashers and you know i wont tell you one of the things because every time i tell you they do a big number on it you know the one im talking about right sinks right showers and what goes with a sink and a shower 10 times right 10 times not me of course not me but you him but i never mention that because one time i mentioned all three i said sinks showers and toilets the headline was trump with the toilets toilets thats all they want they dont even mention it so i didnt mention that okay i go off the record but you know what its terrible you want to wash your hands you turn on the sink no water comes out so you leave the water going 10 times as long its the same thing you have a shower drip its no good for me for me you know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business they always used to say i wore a hairpiece its okay i know people wear hairpieces but they always used to say they dont say that anymore because i have been through the worst storms if you wear one of those suckers you got to give it up fast because within two weeks they got you you look handsome dont worry about it but in the last two decades before my election we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that theyve wanted to do for so many years and thats why it doesnt work we look so forward to taking it on and it is all about cleaning the swamp draining the swamp and we have a very very big bad dangerous swamp okay thats enough of that thats enough so among the very first acts that i did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the us auto industry i withdrew from the horrible trans pacific partnership that would have ended your auto industry a lot of people dont know that but i do remember tpp we were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off the people that made these trade deals its like where do they come like the one in korea that was a hillary clinton special she said this will produce 250000 new jobs and i said well what happened he said well she was right except it was for south korea not for us no its true it produced 250000 jobs for south korea these deals were so bad but now theyre getting really good and some of them are getting great and over a period of time they are going to be phenomenal wait till you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time but we have to go through a little pain because we have to do it and then they all say were going to withdraw and then i say you can withdraw i dont care were putting tariffs on your country then they say wed love to make a deal sir the new usmca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong since the election weve created 41000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs manufacturing jobs remember the statement by president obama youd have to wave a magic wand remember the magic wand because manufacturing and i said you know that sounds strange what do you do if you dont have manufacturing how do you make things right manufacturing jobs wont happen well weve got 600000 manufacturing jobs and youre going to see a big big increase the truth is we need more people you know what we need more people we need more people coming into the country and theyre going to come in and theyre going to come in through merit and theyre going to love our country and theyre going to respect our country and theyre going to work we do need more people theyre opening these massive foxconn in wisconsin theyre opening these massive plants and its hard to get people we want people coming in but they have to come in only they have to come in through merit fiatchrysler recently announced a 45 billion investment in michigan including the first new auto plant in detroit in more than a generation and general motors recently announced a 300 million investment at its orion assembly plant right here in michigan come on general motors lets go general motors gave us a little hard time with one building i wasnt happy about that that was the only building i had a problem within the whole car industry right right you know the one im talking about i didnt like that anyway but theyre spending money you know what can i tell you but these companies are coming in a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to i say you have to or were not trading with you anymore because we had such big deficits with these countries with japan we had a 68 billion deficit i said shinzo hes great prime minister of japan but he said but nobody has ever asked us to do this i said im asking you they are building many many plants theyre building many plants now in the united states the japanese and after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation is that okay we were surrounded with globalists you know they think its okay you open a plant in some country that you never heard of they make your product they send it in the meantime they close all their factories here were not doing that anymore those are globalists they think its wonderful to have deficits i dont they think its great its a great thing to have deficits no those are globalists the globalists are passe our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you the american people before anybody else we must care for our own we must care for our own citizens first democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent americans i dont even know whats happening its terrible and weve moved out thousands and thousands of ms13 thugs out of our country and we have agreements now with guatemala honduras el salvador they didnt use to take them back if we had a murderer then we should get them the hell out we dont really want them in our prisons and take care of them for 50 60 years we want to bring them back they wouldnt take them the planes used to go around and around dont land dont land with us they land we worked out deals with every one of them we stopped giving them all the aid were giving them all this money and then they said were not going to let you land were not going to let you take them back i said thats okay 500 million we were giving them i said now we give them 5 we give them nothing all of a sudden they said we would love to have them back we would love it its wonderful to have them back in june two illegal aliens in sandusky michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife then they hid her body in a water drain a criminal alien with two previous deportations was just arrested in michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death a single mother of five young children its happening all the time far left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities which deliberately release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets we had a great election in north carolina recently two great congressmen got elected you dont hear about it when they win you dont ever hear about it just a few months ago two great people and they got elected and they got elected because i went in and said talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities soon as i mentioned that boom they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great great thing the sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you the people of california they dont like sanctuary cities either theyre stuck with them because they have crazy politicians earlier this year authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of kent county michigan anybody know kent county released an illegal alien charged with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle they let him go to roam free in michigan communities if you want to end sanctuary cities in michigan if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens if you want to have a safe life frankly its so crazy what theyre doing you wouldnt even believe it you have only one choice in 2020 you must vote republican thank you im surprised as you know you do have sanctuary cities in michigan i was almost surprised to hear it but you have them its one of those progressive things they think theyre doing a wonderful favor for the world and now were getting these prosecutors that you murder somebody they give you two months they fight that you dont even have to go to jail whats going on is crazy thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75 since may and weve ended catch and release weve ended it we couldve ended it so easily its called the loophole you catch him and then you release him into a country thats what you had to do by law and if you dont do that they arrest the border patrol people you believe this the border patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people these are the people because look when you have a caravan of eight or 10000 people a lot of those people do you think that guatemala honduras el salvador do you think theyre sending us their finest i dont think so alright how about the lottery that was a schumer deal chuck schumer crying chuck crying chuck schumer i used to be a big contributor to him he used to kiss my ass chuck schumer hed do anything he wouldve done anything for me anything i asked him get schumer on the phone you do this you do that you get him on the phone that son of a bitch he would have done i didnt need anything but he would have done anything now its like the prisoner has not acted give me a break give me a break find out how much money did i give a raise to chuck schumer and chuck give all that money back please carolyn maloney give that money back every penny should come back they act so pompous they act so righteous theyre not righteous theyre not righteous theyre bad people the far left democrats have never been more extreme than they are now democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of healthcare that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor 180 million people are going to lose a lot of people here now have healthcare finally under us thats phenomenal and thats what you want they want to take it away 180 they want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night i dont think so not in this group and you know what some people its good so people but can you imagine they want to take away 180 million people great private highly negotiated healthcare where you have your own doctor remember obama 28 times you can have your doctor you can have your plan didnt work out that way did it i think we should impeach him for that lets impeach him for that for the irs scandal for the guns remember the guns he was giving them to anybody that wanted them he gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didnt have them registered right not to good impeach him why didnt the republicans impeach him those were really how about giving around 18 billion in cash how about that by the way i ended the iran nuclear deal i hope you happy much different country but how about giving iran 18 billion in cash many big planes going over to iran loaded up to the ceiling with cash you know what 18 billion you ever see like at a casino 1 million wrapped up its a big pile of stuff thats a million now multiply it 18 billion in cash he gave so why is he allow to do that did anybody try to impeach him for that everybody knew it was wrong republicans will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions and we will protect your preexisting physicians virtually every top democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth right that is why ive asked congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of god democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption and thats what it is the republican party is the party of the american worker the american family and the american dream and thats really what it is were also the party of the great abraham lincoln a lot of people forget that but we have to bring it up to protect the health and safety of our citizens we awarded 100 million to improve water infrastructure in flint how badly was flint who were the geniuses that did that to you you have clean water coming into flint they had to pay a very tiny little fee so instead they go into this horrible horrible really polluted water and the water comes out of there they spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people it hurt the people but were getting it fixed and i know your previous governor was a republican but i was not a big fan of his i was not but im not a big fan of the one that cant fix the potholes either were committed to ensuring america has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet earth and thats what its about its about clean air and its about clean beautiful water and its about keeping our industry not closing it because of the ridiculous paris climate accord hows paris doing i dont think too well hows paris doing with the yellow vests the yellow vests you know why because they raise gasoline prices so they could send them money all over the world to countries that the people in france never heard of its not working out too well were lowering prices were lowering taxes were making it possible i mean look at gas prices now look at gas prices i recognize israels true capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem and we also recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights big deal for years you watched as your politicians apologized member i would like to apologize i would like to apologize nah we dont apologize now you have a president who is standing up for america and we are standing up for the great people of michigan youre getting your auto industry back at stake in our present battle is the survival of the american nation if you want your children to grow up a land of safety its really we want a land of safety justice well i dont know when i look at those fbi reports we got out we got to clean up a lot what theyve done to hurt people what theyve done to hurt with comey and these horrible people what theyve done to hurt people i

reports are kept did you see the other day well ah ah first time now he said in other words hes 50 there folks hes hit the golden pond anyway so what were doing is were doing things that are going to make our victory its like a tree we need that extra four years weve done so much even right to try you know right to try people were traveling theyre terminally ill theyre traveling all over the world we have the best medical in the world the best doctors the best labs best hospital theyre traveling all over the world to try and get because it takes years to get something approved and i said wait a minute folks why arent we doing this and theyve been trying to do it for 49 years they couldnt get it done not that easy the drug companies didnt want the liability the country didnt want the liability the insurance companies didnt want the liability i said heres what we do well sign an agreement with the people where youre exculpated from all liability huh thats a good idea and its a very strong agreement so we cant get sued but i said listen they were worried theyre going to hurt people i said these people are terminally ill theyre terminally ill and so we do it now nine months ago

why is he doing it you know why im doing it because were doing the thing and look what were doing is were bringing back our country again were respected again were respected again we are so respected you dont even know how respected i went to nato where we were being ripped off because the other countries you have 29 countries and the other countries werent paying their bills they were delinquent in real estate i noticed people are using that word ive been using it for the last year its like a real estate trend thats when they dont pay their rent right well they werent paying and you have to see this chart until i got there they got to pay and they said well does that mean you wont protect us i said you dont want the answer to that question over the last and the secretary general stoltenberg over the last period of just two years i raised not from us nothing from us 130 billion but thats nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying 530 billion more all of those countries my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato he says i never thought this could im telling you if you look its like 15 years just down president obama would go there make a speech id like to thank everybody for being here thanks look great job sayonara goodbye bush they all did nobody ever asked for money we were spending for 100 of nato were protecting europe they rip us off on trade right they rip us off like crazy we lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade were changing that but its a long time its been going on a long time they dont take your product they dont take your cars they dont take your farm product they dont take your medical machines we do a big business they sell us we dont sell them because they put restrictions we have better equipment than them but they make it so that our equipment doesnt qualify its called artificial barriers or nonmonetary barriers its brutal what they do im telling you theyre as bad as china just smaller they are as bad as china just smaller and now chinas doing great were very happy but we have to do something with that we have to take care of our people we cant be ripped off by these countries so nato is ripping us off militarily but now theyre starting to pay big money and thats good we want to help them we want to be there with them but they have to pay they have to pay 530 billion and the fake news doesnt even want to talk about it they dont want to talk about it they talk about other things they dont want to talk about that when youd get a chance though just a couple of weeks maybe you could say over a short period of time nato countries will be paying 530 billion more more not total more hows that good thats not too bad nobody else could do that i guarantee i wont tell you what took place in those closed door meetings some of them dont like me they like obama germany likes obama a lot of these countries france they like obama its embarrassing in france
